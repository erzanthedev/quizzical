# 🧠 Quizzical - A Trivia App
---

## 📋 Project Overview

**Quizzical** is a trivia app that presents 5 random multiple-choice questions pulled from an API. Users answer the questions and can check their score to see which answers were correct or incorrect. At the end of the quiz, users are shown their results, including any wrong answers with the correct answer displayed.

This project was built using a **Figma mockup design**, allowing me to replicate the structure and layout exactly as intended. It sharpened both my design matching and coding skills as I worked from mockups to a functional app.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

This project was built from scratch as part of a solo project in the **Scrimba Course**. The main goal was to test and refine my React skills, including:

- **useState** & **useEffect** hooks
- **Controlled Components**
- **Creating Reusable Components**
- **Conditional Rendering** & **Ternary Statements**
- Using the **Html-entities** library to decode API data
- Handling **Event Listeners**

I combined all my knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React** into this app, following a **Figma mockup design** to ensure pixel-perfect alignment with the prototype.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Start Menu Page**: A simple start screen where users can begin the quiz.
- **QuizQuestions Page**: Displays 5 multiple-choice questions with random answer ordering.
- **Score and Feedback**: After answering, users can check their score and see which answers were correct. Incorrect answers display the right choice.
- **Play Again Button**: After checking answers, the "Check Answers" button switches to a "Play Again" button to restart the quiz.

## 🚀 Challenges & Solutions

This project really pushed me to think critically and problem-solve. Here are a couple of challenges I faced:

1. **Randomizing Answer Order**: To ensure the correct answer didn’t always appear in the same spot, I used the **Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm** to randomize the answer choices.
2. **Restructuring API Data**: I had to refactor the data coming from the API to fit the logic I was using in the app with dummy data. This required careful thought and research to get the data format right.

## 🔧 Future Improvements

Right now, the app pulls 5 general knowledge questions by default. I plan to revisit this project to add new features, such as:

- Letting users choose the number of questions (5, 10, 20).
- Allowing users to select the category of trivia questions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the interactive front-end.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core web technologies for structuring and styling the app.
- **Html-entities Library**: To decode special characters from the API data.
- **Figma**: For the initial design mockup, ensuring a professional layout and style.

## 💡 What I Learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of building interactive apps with React. I also learned the importance of:

- **Thorough research** and **problem-solving** when things don’t work as expected.
- The value of **reusable components** to streamline code.
- Applying various hooks and state management to create a smooth user experience.
- Translating **Figma designs** into fully functional, responsive React components.

Overall, **Quizzical** was an excellent opportunity to **test my React skills** and learn how to approach real-world challenges when building an app from scratch. I'm excited to continue improving and expanding its features! 😊
